    <p>Mewsician is a musical friend designed to help children grow an intrinsic appreciation of music and the encourage social aspect of playing music, rather than simply particpating to assuage their parents' demands.</p>




    <p>Mewsicians light up when it hears someone practicing music. A young musician can touch Mewsician's ear to start a recording of themselves playing. The Mewsician website allows these musicians to store and review their recordings, as well as share them with friends or teachers. As young musicians practice more, they earn more fish, which they can use to buy accessories to dress up their Mewsician.</p>
