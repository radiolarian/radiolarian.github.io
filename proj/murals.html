    <h3>Steven Universe Mural</h3>
    <h4>June 2015</h4>
    <p>Steven Universe is a great show on Cartoon Network, so I naturally had to pay tribute by painting the original Crystal Gems in my co-op's study room. They're fighting Batman!</p>

    <h3 class="new-section">Undertale Mural</h3>
    <h4>January 2016</h4>
    <p><a href="http://undertale.com">Undertale</a> is an nice video game with a lot of heart. I painted some characters in my co-op's Lib-Ed ("family"?) room.</p> 

    <div class="row">
        <div class="6u 12u(small)">
                <img class="image responsive" src="../image/misc/ut2.jpg" alt="A mural of several Undertale characters: Napstablook, Mettaton, Papyrus, Sans, Frisk, Undyne, and Alphys. The way it is constructed in the room it looks like Undyne is holding up a shelf that Mettaton is sitting on.">

        <div class="6u 12u(small)">
                <img class="image responsive" src="../image/misc/ut1.jpg" alt="The same shot of the mural except the furniture has been replaced with the author.">

    <h3 class="new-section">Musical Murals</h3>
    <h4>December 2016</h4>
    <p>I painted two album covers I liked (both visually and musically)—Andrew Bird's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bird_%26_the_Mysterious_Production_of_Eggs">Mysterious Production of Eggs</a> and Sufjan Steven's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Adz">Age of Adz</a>—in the Makerspace. My friend Matthew did the background for the Andrew Bird one, which later contained the Sylvia Plath quote, <i>"I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am. I am. I am."</i></p>

                    <img class="image responsive" src="../image/misc/music.jpg" alt="Andrew Bird's creature on the Mysterious Production of Eggs album cover is on a wall. On the adjacent door is the cover for Sufjan's Age of Adz.">
