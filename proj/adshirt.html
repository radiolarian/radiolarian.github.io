<p>Adshirt transforms your body into a monetization platform. Companies compete for your advertising space through online bids&mdash;and you cash out. Build your reputation with trusted reviews, and ensure a profitable minimum bid by spending time near densely populated spaces. Wear the marketing revolution.</p>

<p>Adshirt was a project for <a href="http://make.berkeley.edu">Critical Making</a>'s final provocation, the wearable. Inspired by tech shirts, Adshirt critiques the relationship between individuality and capitalism. Where do we draw the the line between sacrificing personal expression and making money? As wearables become more intimate and prevalent, Adshirt probes users to explore the nuanced relationships between aesthetics, neoliberalism, and their body.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<img class="image responsive" src="../../image/adshirt/storyboard.png" alt="Storyboard; left to right : user puts on Adshirt; User appears on Adshirt website, Companies bid on user; Winning company's ad is displayed on the user. User earns money.">
<p>From a technical standpoint, we use a Meteor.js server to set up API end points which communicate with the Raspberry Pi inside the Adshirt. Each round, the winning bid's advertisement is posted to this API, and the Pi then displays it. The communication is two-way: the Pi also sends photographs and the 'popularity metric' to the webserver. </p>
